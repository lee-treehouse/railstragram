Devise gave us these routes

/users/sign_up

sign up sets a cookie and logs the user in, accessing sign in page will redirect to the home page in this case with a notification (which is not super noticeable.. ) delete the cookies in lieu of a sign out button for now.

/users/sign_in

there is a devise cheat sheet here
